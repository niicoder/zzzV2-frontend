              <h2>What is ZZZ?</h2>
              <p>
                ZZZ is a community-centered DeFi project by the people, for the
                people. The decisions and actions of ZZZ are made by its members
                and community to assure equity and fairness for all. <br />
                All started by a single developer and now the project is handed
                to the community to grow forwards.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a new form of governance system. A think-tank. A place
                where innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological
                advancements are the priority, creating a much needed utility
                focus to the blockchain space. The value of ZZZ is determined by
                the contribution and innovation of the community as a whole.
              </p>
              <h2>Why ZZZ?</h2>
              <p>
                Owning <b>$ZZZ</b> enables your voice to be heard regarding the
                future of the project in proposal voting and proposal
                initiation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Proposal initiation and voting will be avalaible in the near
                future using a snapshotting system. A gas-relayer system where
                users pay no fees is coming later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Owning ZZZ provides you with unique bonuses on our DeFi-platform
                by providing your deposited assets with a yield bonus according
                to the amount of ZZZ you are holding. So you are gaining the
                upper hand.
              </p>
              <h2>Okay, anything more?</h2>

              <p>
                We have just completed an audit process with CertiK for our
                yield farming contracts. After a few revisions all major and
                critical issues found by CertiK were alleviated and the
                finalized report has been received and our pools have been
                implemented with this standard for quite some time.
              </p>
              <h2>Why?</h2>
              <p>
                We found it necessary to provide a proof of authenticity for our
                partners and investors and we are determined to keep the
                standars up for all upcoming projects.
              </p>
              <h2>CertiK?</h2>
              <p>
                We have chosen CERTIK as they are a trusted and reputable brand
                with unrivalled expertise in the quality of conducting extensive
                and efficient code auditing. Our community deserves nothing but
                the best, and quality polished code is paramount to that.
